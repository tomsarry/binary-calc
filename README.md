# Binary Calculator

# How it works

You have 3 buttons to control the numbers, one to increment, another to decrement and a third to reset the number back to 0.
For every number, you have represented on the site its decimal representation and a binary visual representation using 8 bits.

**Note:** A full circle represents a 1 while a hollow one represents a 0.
